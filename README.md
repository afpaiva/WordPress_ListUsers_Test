## About this test
First, I'd like to thank you for this opportunity to show my skills. I have already worked with PHP and JavaScript, but always on personal projects. This time I had to study different techniques to achieve this result, and it was really productive.Since working with WordPress, making unit tests, parsing JSON file. I climbed some steps in this process, and hope to climb more if having your approbation.

It will be a huge pleasure to talk to you, introduce myself better, and show my interest in working on Inpsyde. I've been watching some videos about Inpsyde, staffs, interview, and I appreciate your integration.

Thanks, all the best,
Andre Fonseca de Paiva
