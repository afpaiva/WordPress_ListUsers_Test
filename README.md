# :clipboard: AFP List Users

This was a test for a job, where I was asked to create a WordPress plugin that reads a JSON URL and show on screen.

## :floppy_disk: Installation

2) Upload the zip file on WordPress plugin instalation section;
3) Activate the plugin on WordPress Admin Page;
4) Access the AFP List Users plugin through the lateral menu.

## :tennis: Usage

Enter with the JSON URL provided by you and click *save & test*.

```bash
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
```
Create a dummy post and enter with the ShortCode *[listusers-job-test]*.

You will be able to see the list of users on your page.

NOTE: Other JSON file can be used, all you have to do is to paste the link and *save & test*. If using other file, please note if this file has the same structure as the original provided.

## :pushpin: About this test
I have already worked with PHP and JavaScript, but always on personal projects. This time I had to study different techniques to achieve this result, and it was really productive. I climbed a lot of steps in this process.

**updating**: I had a feedback, I should study Composer, and unit test.

Thanks,
